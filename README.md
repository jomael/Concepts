A copy of all libraries that the project depends on are included (except commercial ones of course) to avoid installation hassles for anyone who tries to compile the project. 
In the [Concepts.inc](http://github.com/beNative/Concepts/blob/master/Concepts.inc) file you can specify which dependencies you want to have included in your build.

Currently compilation has only been tested in Delphi 10 Seattle and later versions, but it should not be difficult to get it compiled in  Delphi 2010 or later.

Check the [releases](http://github.com/beNative/Concepts/releases) to download a precompiled executable of the project.
