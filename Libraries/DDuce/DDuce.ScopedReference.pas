unit DDuce.ScopedReference;

{
  Implementation of a scoped reference type (smart pointer).

  A scoped reference performs automatic freeing for enclosed objects. Once an
  object is stored in a scoped reference, it is guaranteed to be released when
  the reference goes out of scope.

  Original concept based on DeHL library by Ciobanu Alexandru. You may obtain a
  copy of this library at http://code.google.com/p/delphilhlplib/

  This simplified version only supports a fully managed instance and does not
  allow for shared or weak references to the enclosed object.

  In addition to the original implementation it features automatic instantiation
  of the enclosed object, so the managed object does not need to be created nor
  destroyed as both operations will be handled by the record instance.

  Optionally a factory function for the reference can be specified. If not
  specified the instance will be created using the default constructor of the
  object type.

  In the example 3 different objects are created to show their classname.

  The code below illustrates the traditional object creation and the equivalent
  version using scoped references.

  1. Standard way (using classic boilerplate code)
  ------------------------------------------------
      procedure ShowClassNames;
      var
        O: TObject;
        P: TPersistent;
        L: TList;
      begin
        O := TObject.Create;
        try
          P := TPersistent.Create;
          try
            L := TList.Create;
            try
              ShowMessage(O.ClassName);
              ShowMessage(P.ClassName);
              ShowMessage(L.ClassName);
            finally
              L.Free;
            end;
          finally
            P.Free;
          end;
        finally
          O.Free;
        end;
      end;

  2. Using scoped references (automatic bookkeeping of the enclosed objects)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
      procedure ShowClassNames;
      var
        O: Scoped<TObject>;
        P: Scoped<TPersistent>;
        L: Scoped<TList>;
      begin
        ShowMessage(O.Ref.ClassName);
        ShowMessage(P.Ref.ClassName);
        ShowMessage(L.Ref.ClassName);
      end;

  Optionally you can provide a delegate with the construction code for the
  wrapped type.
  When not provided the default parameterless constructor of the type is used.

  Example using an anonymous method as a delegate to construct the scoped type:

      procedure CreateScopedComponent;
      var
        C: Scoped<TComponent>;
      begin
        C.Create(
          function
          begin
            Result := TComponent.Create(Self);
            Result.Name := 'MyComponent';
          end
        );
        ShowMessage(C.Ref.Name);
      end;
}

    end;

  private
    { FGuard is an interface variable that will be <> nil when an instance is
      created (Unlike normal object reference variables interface variables in
      records are always initialized to nil.) }
    FGuard: IGuard;

    function GetRef: T; inline;

    procedure Reset;

    property Ref: T
      read GetRef;
  end;

  FInstance := AInstance;
end;

begin
  FInstance.Free;
  inherited;
end;

function Scoped<T>.TGuard.GetInstance: T;

  Result := FInstance;
end;

constructor Scoped<T>.Create(const ARefFactory: TFunc<T>);
begin

  FGuard := TGuard.Create(ARefFactory());
end;

function Scoped<T>.GetRef: T;

  if FGuard = nil then
    FGuard := TGuard.Create(T.Create);
  Result := FGuard.Instance
